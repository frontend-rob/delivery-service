# Delivery Service

This project is part of the Frontend Web Development course from the [Developer Akademie.](https://developerakademie.com/) 

<mark>NOTE:</mark> This is a learning project, so not all features may be fully working or implemented. The focus is on learning specific skills and applying them to different parts of the app.

<br>

## Features

Here is an overview of the most important functions of the project:

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts seamlessly across devices. On desktop, the shopping cart remains sticky, providing easy access without interfering with the page's content.

- **Dynamic Menu & Categories:** Dishes are rendered dynamically using arrays and objects, with different categorized sections. Category images visually separate the sections for easy navigation.

- **Cart Management:** Users can add or remove dishes from the cart, adjust quantities, and the total price updates dynamically. When the same dish is added multiple times, quantities stack.

- **Order Process:** Users can select between delivery or pickup options. The app includes a variable minimum order value for delivery, preventing orders from being placed until it's reached. After clicking the Pay button, the cart is cleared, and a confirmation message is shown.
